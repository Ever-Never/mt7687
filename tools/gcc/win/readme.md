Put arm-none-eabi cross compiler for Windows here.
Or setup a soft link to the path of `arm-none-eabi-gcc` in Cygwin, eg:

  ```
  $ ln -s ~/Tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2-20160622 gcc-arm-none-eabi
  ```

> Assume downloading `arm-none-eabi-gcc` from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download and extrac the tarball at ~/Tools
