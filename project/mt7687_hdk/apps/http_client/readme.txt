@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - There are three example projects under this directory: http_client_get, http_client_keepalive, http_client_retrieve.
 - Features of the example project
   - Http_client_get is a simple demonstration program which shows how to use the httpclient APIs. It executes a HTTP GET request to a webserver and print the response content to the log.
   - Http_client_keepalive demonstrates how to keep a long connection with a website and send requests to it at predefined intervals.
   - Http_client_retrieve demonstrates how to segemented download a large object.

@par Hardware and software environment

  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7687 HDK.

  - PC/environment configuration
   - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, for UART logging.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.
    - Configure a Wi-Fi router with the SSID as SQA_TEST_AP, password as 77777777, and authentication mode as WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK. The Wi-Fi router should have the internet connection.
    - You can also change the default settings in wifi_connect_init() in main.c to adapt the device to your Wi-Fi Accesss Point by specifying authentication mode, encryption mode, SSID, and password.

@par Run the example
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7687_hdk http_client_get" under the SDK root folder and download the http_client_get.bin file to MT7687.
  - Press the reset button on the board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example. It will show HTTP client log.
