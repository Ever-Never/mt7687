@par Run the example
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7687_hdk cjson" from the SDK root folder and download the bin file to LinkIt 7687 development board.
  - Press the reset button on the board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example. It will show cJSON log, such as "cjson_test starts".
