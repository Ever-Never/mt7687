@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - This example project shows the useage of APIs of mbedTLS.
 - Features of the example project
   - AES: AES encryption & decryption demonstration program
   - MD5: md5 demonstration program
   - MPI: MPI demonstration program
   - RSA encrypt & decrypt: RSA encryption & decryption demonstration program
   - PK encrypt & decrypt: Public key-based encryption & decryption program
   - Selftest: Self-test demonstration program
   - SSL client: SSL client demonstration program.

@par Hardware and software environment

   - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7687 HDK.

   - PC/environment configuration
    - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, for UART logging.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.
    - Set up a WiFi router which connects to the internet.
      - Router settings: name: SQA_TEST_AP, password: 77777777, auth mode: WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK.
      - You can also change the default settings in wifi_connect_init() in main.c to adapt the device to your Wi-Fi Access Point by specifying authentication mode, encryption mode, SSID, and password.

   - mbedtls/MDK-ARM/flash.sct            Linker script.

@par Run the example
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7687_hdk mbedtls" from the SDK root folder and download the bin file to LinkIt 7687 development board.
  - Run the example. The log will show the test results.

@par Configuration
  - Each feature is independent with each other, you can check one or several of them independently by modifing main.c, for example, you can just keep aes_main() and comment the other xxx_main() to check the demonstration of AES only.
