@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - This project describes how to setup FreeRTOS multitasking environment.
 - Features of the example project
   - The project creates four tasks. Each task sleeps for a certain amount of time measured in OS ticks and prints the logs when it awakes.
 - Process / procedure of the example project
   - Declare and initialize four tasks and schedule at different intervals.
 - Output from the example
   - Log will show when a task wakes up.

@par Hardware and software environment

  - Supported HDK
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7687 HDK.
    
  - PC/environment configuration
   - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, for UART logging.
   - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Connect the board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt2523_hdk freertos_thread_creation" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Run the example. The log will show "hello world x", where x is the task ID with the range from 0 to 3.
