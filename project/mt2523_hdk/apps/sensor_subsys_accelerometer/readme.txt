@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - This project describes how to use the sensor subsystem API to get the sensor data.
 - Features of the example project
   - This project demonstrates how to use sensor subsystem API to get accelerometer sensor data.
 - Process / procedure of the example project
   - Accelerometer is enabled to measure the acceleration.
 - Output from the example
   - Log will show the received accelerometer data.

@par Hardware and software environment

  - Supported HDK
    - MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK.
    - MediaTek Sensor DTB. (Model number: WS3437)

  - PC/environment configuration
    - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, for UART logging.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.
    - Sensor DTB needs to be plugged into MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK. The interface is near the Audio jack with "Sensor" labeled on MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK.

@par Run the demo
  - Connect the board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt2523_hdk sensor_subsys_accelerometer" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Run the example. Move MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK to trigger the accelerometer data change. The log will show the accelerometer data.
