@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - This project shows the simple usage of ATCI module APIs to register new AT commands.
 - Features of the example project
   - This project demonstrates how to add new AT command.
 - Process / procedure of the example
   - Input to the example: Type in the test command "AT+TESTCMD" from a UART, such as Tera Term hyper terminal.
   - Output from the example: The log will show the ATCI module processing and the AT command response "+TESTCMD:HELLO.OK" will show on the hyper terminal.

@par Hardware and software environment

  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK.

  - PC/environment configuration
   - A serial tool is required, such as Tera Term, for UART logging and inputing the AT command from UART.
   - COM port setting. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Build the example project with the command for GCC compiler, "./build.sh mt2523_hdk atci_register_command bl" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cables, UART 1 for logging, UART 2 for AT command.
  - Open serial tools for logging and AT command.
  - Run the example. Input AT command "AT+TESTCMD" thourgh the UART 2. The log will show the ATCI module processing and the AT command response "ERROR" will show on command input tool through the UART 2.
